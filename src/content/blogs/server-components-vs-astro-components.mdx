React Server Components (RSC) are the, (not so) new hype in React, I guess you know them if you are here, but for those of you who do not
RSC from nextjs docs: React Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server.

RSC has a comlplicated modle, they are written using React of course, and the data that is streamed to the client, 
it is not HTML, but is some odd json that represents a component that should be inserted into the components tree.

On the other hand Astro components are much less complicated in my opinion. They are HTML-only templating components with no client-side runtime. 
As it says on the astro websitte, it is just good old HTML, with some extra features.


In this article I will compare RSC with Astro Components to see if there any advantage to either one.
