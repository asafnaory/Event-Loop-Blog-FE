A few days ago I got a task. 
I needed to create a list of hanlders that will run one after the other in a row and will munipulte a json returned from an other microservice in order to return it properly to the client. 
Each hander sould receive the output of the handler the came before it, and return its value to the handler after it.
As a part of this task I wanted to crete a function that will run this list of handlers and will return the final result.
this function needed to get a list of handler `Hander[]` and return the last ones result.
I wanted to create a type for this funtion. the type should look as the following:

```typescript
    function runHandlers(handlers: Handler[]): HandlerResult {
        //...
    }
```

Cool, I thought, I will just create a type for the Handler and I'm all set.
Handler can be a function with any input and any output.
however I can't use the type `any` because we don't use `any` in our code base and I don't want to break this rules.
No worries, I know another top level type - `unknown`, I will use it.

# unknown to the rescue
I wrote the following type:

```typescript
    type Handler = (...input: unknown[]) => unknown;
```
all set right? wrong!

after I was done I tried to use this `Handler` type on my functions, for example:

```typescript
    type Handler = (...input: unknown[]) => unknown;
    function foo: Handler = (p: number) => {
        p.toFixed();
    }

    //or

    function foo: Handler = (p: string) => {
        p.charAt();
    }

```

and I got the following error:

```typescript
    Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'number'.
   //or 
    Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

</CenteredDiv>

Wait what? Type `unknown` is not assignable to type `number`? 
1. I did the opposite - I was trying to assign a function with a parmeter of type `number` to my general type function  with a parmeter of type `unknown`.
2. I thought that `unknown` is the new `any` and I can use it as a top level type.
3. I thought all top level types are simmiar and when I changed the type to `any` it did work.

```typescript
    type Handler = (...input: any[]) => unknown;
    // works
```

I thought I know everything about typescript, but I was wrong. So started to look for the answer until I found it.

# Covariance and Contravariance

before the explanation of Covariance and Contravariance, during this part of the article I will use the following type:

```typescript
    type IsSubtype<S, P> = S extends P ? true : false;
```
This type will help us to check if `S` is a subtype of `P`. if it is it will return `true` otherwise it will return `false`.

Lets go back. Some of the typescript types are covariant. It means that if type `A` is a subtype of type `B` then `T<A>` is a subtype of `T<B>`.
For example the Promise type is covariant. if `A` is a subtype of `B` then `Promise<A>` is a subtype of `Promise<B>`.

```typescript
    type T = IsSubtypeOf<Promise<A>, Promise<B>> 
    // true
```

Some of the typescript types are contravariant. It means that if type `A` is a subtype of type `B` then `T<B>` is a subtype of `T<A>`.
for example functions are contravariant. if `A` is a subtype of `B` then `(param: B) => void` is a subtype of `(param: A) => void`.

```typescript
    type IsSubtype<S, P> = S extends P ? true : false;
    type T = IsSubtypeOf<(param: B) => void, (param: A) => void>
    // true
```
Now with this knowledge, think about my case again. I had a type `Handler` and I tried to set my `foo` fucntion to be of type `Handler`.
That means that that my `foo` function is a subtype of the `Handler` type.
But we said that functions are contravariant, so if `foo` is a subtype of `Handler`, then `F<Handler>` is a subtype of `F<typeof foo>` (F for Function).
From that the error. Typescript tries to set the `Handler` into `typeof foo` since it is its subtype and `unknown` can not be set to `number` or `string`.
That how we got to this error: Type `unknown` is not assignable to type `number` 

# But why?

If you think about that it does make sense.

Think about the next example: 

```typescript
    type unknownFoo = (...p: unknown[]) => void
    function numberFoo: unknownFoo(p: number): void {
        p.toFixed();
    }
    numberFoo('hello', 1, true);
```
That will pass compilation, `'hello', 1, true` are of type `unknown[]` but will fail at runtime because `p` is not a number it is `[string, number, boolean]`.  
But if typescript will rais an error it will protect us from this runtime error. Well how will it know? 
It can reverse the order of the types and check if its valid.
Clever right?

Just so you know this is valid code and working as expected:

```typescript
    type neverFoo = (...p: never) => void
    function numberFoo: neverFoo(p: number): void {
        p.toFixed();
    }
```

Why? because now you can not do this:

```typescript
    numberFoo('hello', 1, true);
```
Acctually you can not pass anything to `numberFoo` because `never` is a type that can not be set to anything. You can not call it at all,
but typescipt can be sure that you not get a runtime error.


# so what is the solution?
## The satisfies Operator
Typescript has a special operator (typescript 4.9) that can help us with this problem. The operator is `satisfies`.
`satisfies` help us to ensure that some expression matches some type, 
but also want to keep the most specific type of that expression for inference purposes.

Lets see how it solves our issue: 

```typescript
    type neverFoo = (...p: never) => void
    function numberFoo(p: number): void {
        p.toFixed();
    } satisfies neverFoo

    numberFoo(1)
    // works
```
now I can use `neverFoo` as a type for `numberFoo` and it **will** work.
