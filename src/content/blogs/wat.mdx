Many of you may be familiar with the video **Wat by Gary Bernhardt**, but if you are not, 
I highly recommend checking it out. It showcases some of the oddities of JavaScript. 
In this article, I will try to explain some of the phenomena presented in the video.

Firstly, JavaScript is a weakly typed language.


This means that the type of a variable can change at runtime. This is why JavaScript employs *Type Coercion*.

*Type Coercion* refers to the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another.

Now, let's break down the rules of the + operator.

# The + Operator
### Primitives: 
1. If both operands are numbers, they are added.
2. If both operands are strings, they are concatenated.
3. If either operand is a string, the other is converted to a string and concatenated.

### Non-Primitives
#### Objects
4. If JavaScript interprets the operand as an object, it first tries to convert it to a number, which usually fails, then tries to convert it to a string.

* Not related to the + operator specifically, but for clarification - if the left operand is `{}`, JavaScript actually treats it as a block scope, not as an object. It reads and ignores it in the context of the + operator. To have JavaScript interpret it as an object, you need to wrap it with parentheses `({})`.

#### Arrays
5. If one of the operands is an array, it is converted to a string and concatenated.


Now, let's analyze the code from the video with this in mind.
<CenteredDiv>
![Alt text for your image](/wat-1.png)
</CenteredDiv>
```javascript
[] + [] // ""
```
The two arrays are converted to empty strings and then concatenated, resulting in an empty string.

```javascript
[] + {} // "[object Object]"
```
The first array is converted to an empty string and concatenated with the string representation of the object, which is `[object Object]`.

```javascript
{} + [] // 0
```
Here, `{}` is not an object but a block scope, so we essentially have `+[]`, which is syntactic sugar for `Number([])` or `Number('')`, resulting in `0`.

```javascript
{} + {} // NaN
```
Similarly, the first `{}` is a block scope, and the second `{}` is an object. The expression effectively becomes `Number({})`, which results in NaN.


Let's move on to the second part of the video.

Understanding the `Array.join()` method is crucial here.

The `join()` method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all elements in an array (or an array-like object), 
separated by commas or a specified separator string (remember this). 
If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.

For example:
```javascript
const elements = ['Fire', 'Air', 'Water'];
console.log(elements.join());
//output: "Fire,Air,Water"
```

```javascript
const elements = ['Fire', 'Air', 'Water'];
console.log(elements.join('-'));
//output: "Fire-Air-Water"
```
So, with that in mind, let's read the code from the video.

```javascript
Array(16)
//output: [ <16 empty items> ]
```

In older JavaScript environments, this might have printed 16 commas, but in modern JavaScript, it prints `[ <16 empty items> ]`, an array with 16 empty items.

```javascript
Array(16).join('wat')
//output: "watwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwat
```
Here, we have an array with 16 empty items, and we join them with the string `'wat'`, adding `'wat'` between each item.

```javascript
Array(16).join('wat' +1);
//output: "wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1"
```
Here, we have an array with 16 empty items and we join them with the string wat + 1 which as we know: when using the + operator if either operand is a string, convert the other one to a string and concatenate.
So we have an array with 16 empty items and we join them with the string wat1 which means that we add wat1 between each item.

```javascript
Array(16).join('wat' -1) + ' Batman!'
//output: "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN Batman!"
```
Here, we have an array of 16 `'wat' - 1`. Here Javascript can not know how to *Type Coercion* either of the operands, so `'wat' - 1` evaluates to NaN.
Then we concatenate the string Batman! to the end of the string.

### To sum up:


JavaScript is a weakly typed language, with the functionality of *Type Coercion*.
JavaScript operators are not always intuitive, and sometimes they can be very confusing.

Honestly, I hope this article was fun to read because I am not sure how useful it is.
